## 🧠 About Me

👋 Hi, I'm **Elvis Ibenacho** , a passionate backend engineer and cybersecurity analyst with 4+ years of experience. I specialize in building secure and scalable APIs using **Python**, **Django**, and **PostgreSQL** — with a strong foundation in **data security and resilience**.

💻 I’m currently enrolled in the **ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Program**, where I collaborate on real-world projects, reinforce CS fundamentals, and strengthen my backend expertise.

🌍 My *North Star* is to build inclusive and intelligent backend systems that create impact — particularly in the **health** and **fintech** industries.

🔐 With a unique mix of software engineering and cybersecurity skills, I prioritize **security-first development** and deliver APIs that can be trusted.
